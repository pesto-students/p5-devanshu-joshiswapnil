A)	MAIN FUNCTIONALITY OF THE BROWSER

A web browser, also known as a browser, is an application software that allows users to find, access, display, and view websites. Microsoft Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Apple Safari are all popular web browsers.

Web browsers are primarily used to display and access websites on the internet, as well as other content created with programming languages such as Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) and Extensible Markup Language (XML) (XML). Browsers convert Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) web pages and websites into human-readable content. They can also show other protocols and prefixes, such as secure HTTP (HTTPS), File Transfer Protocol (FTP), email handling (mailto:), and files (file:).

A web browser’s primary function is to render HTML, the code that is used to design or markup web pages. When a browser loads a web page, it processes the HTML, which may contain text, links, and references to images and other items like CSS and JavaScript functions. The browser then renders these objects in the browser window after processing them. A web browser (also known as a browser) is a software application that allows you to access information on the World Wide Web. When a user requests a web page from a specific website, the web browser requests the content from a web server and shows it on the user’s device.
